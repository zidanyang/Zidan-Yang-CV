career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I'm a PhD student at Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience (MPFI) who's keen on system neuroscience. 
      I'm trying to understand the neural dynamics among cortical and subcortical regions during flexible motor timing in mice, using
      large-scale electrophysiology, optogenetics manipulation and computational analysis.
